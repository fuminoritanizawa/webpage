  Participated in [Professor Monica Mugnier's genetic parasitology lab](https://www.mugnierlab.org/) focused on sleeping sickness
  - Investigated the impact of the extravascular environment on antigenic variation in *Trypanosoma brucei*, a key parasite invasion mechanism, by developing protocols for extracting extracellular fluid (EF) from the organs of infected mice.
  - Performed precise dissections and evaluated techniques such as blood washing, perfusion, and centrifugation to isolate EF with minimal contamination, validated by 108 samples through SDS-PAGE analysis.
  - Proposed low immune pressure as a potential driver of antigenic variation by establishing an EF extraction method and conducting ELISA for IgG/M on the extracted EF.

  Collaborated with [Prof. Mark Ilton's team](https://posmlab.org) on a biophysical research project, modeling both hardware and software aspects of Conus marmoreus injection latch.
  - Studied the mechanical characterization of elastic biological materials, crucial for animal locomotion, which exhibit a highly non-linear mechanical response and are rate-dependent due to complex dynamic relaxation processes.
  - Conducted recoil experiments to characterize the high-rate, large deformation response of elastic materials, involving stretching a clamped material, measuring force and displacement, then releasing the material and measuring the recoil using high-speed videography.
  - Analyzed the dynamics of elastic energy release to infer the high-rate and large deformation mechanical properties of the material.
  - Contributed to ongoing efforts to develop a methodology for inferring mechanical properties from recoil experiments, enabling the characterization of elastic biological materials during ultrafast movement.
