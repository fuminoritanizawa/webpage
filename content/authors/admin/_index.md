  Hi! I’m Fumi, a PhD student in <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/immunol.html" target="_blank">Immunology at Stanford Medicine</a>. I'm very passionate about host-pathogen interactions in infectious diseases, using both dry and wet approaches. My goal is to advance science that serves those most affected by disease&mdash;often communities neglected by mainstream research and healthcare systems.
</p>

<p>
  I bring a strong foundation in both molecular benchwork and computational biology, with research experience at Scripps Research, Johns Hopkins, the National University of Singapore, and Harvey Mudd College. I earned my B.S. in Computational Biology from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2025, with a humanities concentration in Environmental Analysis.
</p>

<p>
Always open to new collaborations or opportunities&mdash;feel free to reach out!
