    Hi! I’m Fumi, an incoming PhD student in Immunology at 
    <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/immunol.html" target="_blank">Stanford Medicine</a>. 
    I’m passionate about host-pathogen interactions in infectious diseases, using both dry and wet approaches.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have a strong background in computational biology and robust molecular bench training. 
    My research spans projects at Scripps Research (<em>C. elegans</em> neurosci), Johns Hopkins (parasite infections in mice), 
    the National University of Singapore (butterfly evo-devo), and Harvey Mudd College (bacterial infection in <em>Drosophila</em>).
  </p>

  <p>
    I graduated from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2025 with a degree in Computational Biology 
    and a humanities concentration in Environmental Analysis. Grounded in a liberal arts education, I value an interdisciplinary lens, bridging molecular biology, global health, and social equity, and thus, pursue research aimed at improving outcomes for underserved communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m always open to new collaborations or opportunities&mdash;feel free to reach out!
  </p>
