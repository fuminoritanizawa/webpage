    Hi! I’m Fumi, an incoming PhD student in <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/immunol.html" target="_blank">Immunology at Stanford Medicine</a>. 
    I’m passionate about host-pathogen interactions in infectious diseases, using both dry and wet approaches.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have a strong background in computational biology and molecular benchwork, with research spanning Scripps Research, Johns Hopkins, the National University of Singapore, and Harvey Mudd College. 
  </p>    
  <p>
    I graduated from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2025 with a BSc in Computational Biology and a concentration in Environmental Analysis. Grounded in a liberal arts education, I approach disease through an interdisciplinary lens—linking molecular biology, global health, and social equity to pursue research that benefits underserved communities.
  </p>

<p>
  I’m always open to new collaborations or opportunities&mdash;feel free to reach out!
